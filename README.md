# Educational Archive

This repository contains my LaTeX notes and reference materials used in my academic studies and self-education.

## Structure

Notes are organized by subject, with each folder containing:
- A compiled PDF version (`.pdf`)
- Supporting resources (books, other notes, etc.)

> A LaTeX source files (`.tex`) are in the `/src`

## Requirements

To compile `.tex` files locally, you may need a modern TeX distribution such as:
- [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com)

2. Keep content clear, consistent, and organized by topic.
3. Follow existing formatting conventions.
4. Submit a pull request with a short description of your changes.
